  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size. 
    Analyzing time complexity helps developers design more <em>efficient</em> algorithms 
    by predicting performance as data scales.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. 
    For example, an algorithm with space complexity of O(n) requires memory that grows linearly 
    with the input size, making it important to consider Space Complexity when optimizing resources.
